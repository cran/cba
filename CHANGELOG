Release 0.1
Release date: 2005-05-30

Alpha release of the Rock package which implements the Rock algorithm.
Focus is on efficient implementation of time critical functions: distance
computation and merging.

Release 0.1-1
Release date: 2005-07-02

Bug fixes, better fitting in with existing R functionality (e.g. class dist).
Added efficient conversion of nominal variables to dummy coding.

Release 0.1-2
Release date: 2005-08-30

Major changes include merging in of Proximus. Visualization is sketchy but
useable. Most of the stuff definitely belongs to separate packages. However, 
it all ended up here. The C code is at least -Wall -pedantic clean.

Release 0.1-3
Release date: 2005-09-08

The package develops into a trash bag: moved optimal leaf ordering and stuff in. This sucks!

Release 0.1-4
Release date: 2005-09-12

Added drop option to as.dummy and sparse K-means code. 
Added clusimplot (Michael)
Added Mushroom data set (Michael)

Release 0.1-5
Release date: 2005-10-26

Fixed similarity conversion for intraClusterSim in clusimplot (Michael)
renamed clusimplot to cluproxplot (Cluster Proximity plot) (M)
cluproxplot uses grid now and includes a silhouettes plot (M)
added interface for seriation (M)


Release 0.1-6
Release date: 2005-12-12

cluproxplot uses now really grid (M)
added colorkey for cluproxplot (M)

Release 0.1-7
Release date: 2006-27-01

added cluProxMatrix class w/ print and plot methods (M)
simplified the cluproxplot interface by using plotOptions for all plotting 
	related options (m)
added threshold to cluproxplot (M)

Release 0.1-8
Release date: 2006-03-01

fixed random-access bug in subset_dist C code which made the return 
value dependent on the order of the subset indexes (C)
added names to cluster labels in rockCluster and ccfksm (C)
added C code for fuzzy binary distance computation (C)
added C code for distance computation on sequences (C)
reduced cluproxplots memory needs (M)
