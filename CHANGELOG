Release 0.1
Release date: 2005-05-30

Alpha release of the Rock package which implements the Rock algorithm.
Focus is on efficient implementation of time critical functions: distance
computation and merging.

Release 0.1-1
Release date: 2005-07-02

Bug fixes, better fitting in with existing R functionality (e.g. class dist).
Added efficient conversion of nominal variables to dummy coding.

Release 0.1-2
Release date: 2005-08-30

Major changes include merging in of Proximus. Visualization is sketchy but
useable. Most of the stuff definitely belongs to separate packages. However, 
it all ended up here. The C code is at least -Wall -pedantic clean.

Release 0.1-3
Release date: 2005-09-08

The package develops into a trash bag: moved optimal leaf ordering and stuff in. This sucks!

Release 0.1-4
Release date: 2005-09-12

Added drop option to as.dummy and sparse K-means code. 
Added clusimplot (Michael)
Added Mushroom data set (Michael)

Release 0.1-5
Release date: 2005-10-26

Fixed similarity conversion for intraClusterSim in clusimplot (Michael)
renamed clusimplot to cluproxplot (Cluster Proximity plot) (M)
cluproxplot uses grid now and includes a silhouettes plot (M)
added interface for seriation (M)


Release 0.1-6
Release date: 2005-12-12

cluproxplot uses now really grid (M)
added colorkey for cluproxplot (M)

Release 0.1-7
Release date: 2006-01-27

added cluProxMatrix class w/ print and plot methods (M)
simplified the cluproxplot interface by using plotOptions for all plotting 
	related options (m)
added threshold to cluproxplot (M)

Release 0.1-8
Release date: 2006-03-01

fixed random-access bug in subset_dist C code which made the return 
value dependent on the order of the subset indexes (C)
added names to cluster labels in rockCluster and ccfksm (C)
added C code for fuzzy binary distance computation (C)
added C code for distance computation on sequences (C)
reduced cluproxplots memory needs (M)
introduced hcl colorspace and fixed colorkey for cluproxplot (M)

Release 0.1-9
Release date: see next

fixed asymmetric weights bug in sdists (C)
added traceback function for sdists (C)
fixed bug due to copy on change in all distance functions (C)
added rowSums.dist and dapply (C)
added interrupt checks to all distance functions (C)
added traceback plot for sdists (C)
added cluster.dist (C)

Release 0.2-0
Release date: 2006-08-31

added stress (C)
fixed future problems with strict type checking in C
by using SET_STRING_ELT instead of SET_ELEMENT.

Release 0.2-1
Release date: 2006-09-04

fixed Windoze C99 versus gnu99 issues (C)
fixed order.matrix and order.data.frame (C)
