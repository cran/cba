* complete this list with known issues.

* improve the documentation.

* consider an option for handling of ties
  in clusterers (which support it).

* standard methods for ccfkms are missing

* unit tests to detect bugs caused by changes 
  in the R source code. at least my trust is
  gone with the copy on write issue.

* reconsider overloading of image.matrix

* replace Calloc with calloc, etc. and use
  own checks and cleanups.

* dist and sdist could issue a warning if
  NAs occur in the result.

* check again the duplicate or not issue :-(
